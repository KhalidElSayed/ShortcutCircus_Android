ShortcutCircus is a sample Android application demonstrating how to
create custom shortcuts in the launcher. Google's official API docs
don't give much detail on how to do this, but there are explanations
all over the Web, in particular Christof Dorner's snippets here
<http://codinggeek.org/tag/home-screen-shortcuts/>.
